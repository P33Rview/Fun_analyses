# Fun analyses

1) ## **CZ Election 2021 analysis**: 

An analysis, that uncovers several insights of the Parliament elections in Czech republic during year 2021. The underlying dataset used for this analysis was acquired from the https://www.czso.cz/ website. The initial motivation of this project was my curiosity to investigate the correlation between the education and number of preference votes of each candidate running for the political office.

2) ## **Holidays in Czech republic**: 

In this analysis, I was interested in which coming years will be the best in terms of the most public holidays on a weekday. I was only interested in holidays, which were fixed to a certain date. The results are stored as a simple dashboard in the following link:

3) ## **Crypto Profit Calculator**:

I was curious how my crypto assets were performing, so I devised a basic profit calculator by comparing the buy price with the Coinmarketcap's API (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).
